*DESCRIPTION*:


 **Machine Learning Model Implementation**

For this task, I developed a machine learning model to identify whether a given message is spam or not. I used the **scikit-learn** library in Python along with other data processing tools.

The process began by loading an SMS dataset and cleaning the data to make it ready for analysis. I converted the text messages into a numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**, which helps the algorithm understand word importance. The dataset was then split into training and testing portions so the model could learn patterns from one set and be evaluated on unseen data.

I selected the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm because it works efficiently for text classification tasks. After training, I tested the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to measure how well it detected spam messages.

Finally, I validated the model with my own sample inputs to confirm its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

**Tools and Resources Used:**

* Python programming language
* Scikit-learn for model building
* NLTK for text processing
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
* Open-source SMS spam dataset
